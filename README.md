# Quadratic Complexity Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of three algorithms with quadratic time complexity \(O(n^2)\). The algorithms are:

1. **Anagram Checker**: Checks if two strings are anagrams of each other.
2. **Valid Triangle Counter**: Counts the number of valid triangles that can be formed from an array of side lengths.
3. **All Pairs Finder**: Finds all possible pairs of elements in a given array.

The project also includes a Python script to measure the execution time of these algorithms and visualize their performance using `matplotlib` and `pandas`.
